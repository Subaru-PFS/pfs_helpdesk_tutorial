# PFS Helpdesk Tutorial

Welcome! 
This webpage provides an introduction to the Subaru Prime Focus Spectrograph data reduction pipeline (PFS DRP) and inspection process. In the future, it may also include guidance on using the Science Platform for analyzing data products.

We welcome comments and contributions to improve this documentation. If you would like to contribute, please follow these steps:

1. **Create a branch** and edit the Markdown files (`*.md`) in the `docs/` folder.
   - **Do not edit the HTML files** in the `site/` folder directly, as this website is managed using *MkDocs*. Any modifications to the HTML files may be lost upon recompilation.

2. **Submit a pull request** with your changes.

All updates will be reviewed for consistency before being merged.
Thank you for your contributions!
