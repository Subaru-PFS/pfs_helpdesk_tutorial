# File Access

After running the PFS 2D DRP, data reduction are performed and the spectrum products are constructed.

## The Location of Data Products

---

**NOTE**: While you can access files written to a datastore configured on a regular filesystem, it is recommended to use the data butler. The contents of the datastore, including filenames and locations, are an implementation detail of the data butler, and subject to change without notice.


First, where can we find the product files? 
In this assumed working directory and user rerun, the output files are located under `$WORKDIR/pfs/data/datastore/u/(username)/object/`. 

You can check by:

```
ls $WORKDIR/pfs/data/datastore/u/(username)/object/
```

You may find a folder named by date and time, e.g., `20250218T070224Z`. This is one of the reruns for your `object` collection. 
If you run the processing multiple times, different folders with specific timestamps will be created.

Let's inspect the contents of  `20250218T070224Z/`:

```
$ ls 20250218T070224Z

```

You will see a bunch of directories. Refer to the release document as well as to the [datamodel](https://github.com/Subaru-PFS/datamodel/blob/master/datamodel.txt) for details.
Here is a brief summary of some of the most important files: `pfsArm` contains 1D-extracted, wavelength-calibrated spectra for each arm (`b`, `r`, `n`, `m`) separately. Here, `b`=blue, `r`=red, `n`=nearIR, and `m`=medium resolution red-arm. The arms are combined in a `pfsMerged` file. Note that the sky subtraction has been performed in `pfsMerged`. Then the pipeline applies the flux calibration and `pfsCalibrated` is a fully calibrated 1d spectrum for a visit. Finally, `pfsCoadd` is a coadd spectrum from multiple visits.
